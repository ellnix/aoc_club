    Each scanner has a fixed number of locations it can be at.
    The location is cyclic and we only care if it is in the top position or not.
    If we "unwrap" the path, it can be viewed as a cyclic path, eg (0 1 2 1 0) -> (0 1 2 3 0).
    The position can be computed as (picoseconds % interval) where the second half of the cycle
    maps to to the first half but in an upwards direction.

    Given that we only care if `(picoseconds % interval) == 0` and not the actual position,
    we don't need to track the position.
    We just need the interval `(range - 1) * 2.
