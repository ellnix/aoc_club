    We are trying to solve for a delay which allows us to make it past all the scanners.
    Scanners are periodic with some `interval`.
    The combined period of all the scanners is `lcm(intervals)`.
    If the solution is 123 then `123 + period * k` would get us pass the scanners for all values of `k`.
    There may be multiple ways to get through all the scanners, eg `123 + period * k` and `456 + period * k`.
    I will denote those as `{123, 456} + period * k`.

    The problem can be broken down into groups.
    For the approach, a group is a collection of scanners with the same period.
    For any subset of scanners, there is a set of solutions which will pass through those scanners.
    Solutions can be (1) computed for each group and then (2) combined.

    1. Computing solutions for a group.

    Note: a scanner with period 4 and depth 1 is functionally equivalent to a scanner with period 4 and depth (1 + 4 * k).
    When computing the depths for a scanner, we can use `depth % interval` to simplify.

    If we have a group of scanners which all have a period of 4, we can denote all soltutions as a subset of `{0, 1, 2, 3} + 4 * k`.
    The depth of the scanners tells us which starts are not valid.
    If a scanner has period 4, the scanner will be at location 0 after `4 * k`.
    We will arrive at the scanner after `delay + depth` ticks.
    We require that `delay + depth != 4 * k` or `delay != 4 * k - depth`.
    Considering only the first interval (k = 1) that gives invalid start delays of `4 - depth` or `period - depth`.
    Valid starts are what remains: `set(range(period)) - invalid_starts`.

    2. Combining group solutions.

    Combining solutions requires finding where the solutions overlap -- values that valid for both groups.
    The combined solution will always be a subset of the solutions which hold for both groups;
    the combined solution will be valid for both groups but may be more specific/narrow.

    If two groups have solutions `{1, 2, 3} + 5 * k` and `{2, 3, 4} + 5 * k` then the combined solution is {2, 3} + 5 * k`.
    Those start delays would get us pass the scanners for both groups.

    When the period for the groups differ, we need to "normalize" the solutions to use a common period (the lcm).
    If two groups have solutions `{1} + 2 * k` and `{2} + 3 * k`, we can rewrite those in terms of the lcm 6:
    `{1, 3, 5} + 6 * k` and {2, 5} + 6 * k`. Once the period matches, the combined solution is `{5} + 6 * k`.

    Note: actually expanding can be expensive when the two periods are very different.
    Instead I expand the solution with the larger period (fewer values generates) then check if those would be in the other solution.

    This combination can be applied repeatedly until all groups are accounted for, then the min(delays) is the answer.
